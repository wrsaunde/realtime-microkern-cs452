# CS452 Realtime Micro Kernel

This is a project for
[CS452](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs452/) at the University
of Waterloo. It's a result of the many hours William Saunders and I
spent in the trains lab in 2011.

Included is a realtime micro kernel, and application code to run atop
it for controlling a model train set. A simple game where the trains
represent "repair robots" which you must outsmart to destroy the
spaceship (represented by the track) is included.
